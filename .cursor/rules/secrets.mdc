# Kamal Secrets Management

When working with secrets and credentials:
- Never commit plain text secrets to the repository
- Use Kamal's built-in secrets management for all environment-specific values
- Store development secrets in .env.development.local (gitignored)
- Reference secrets in code using ENV variables
- Update the deploy.yaml whenever we add a new ENV variable
