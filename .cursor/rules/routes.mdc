# Rails Routes Format

Routes should be organized as follows:
- Group routes by resource or feature
- Use RESTful routes when possible
- Add comments to clarify non-standard routes
- Minimize custom routes

Example:
```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  # Authentication
  devise_for :users
  
  # Public pages
  root to: 'home#index'
  get 'about', to: 'home#about'
  
  # Core resources
  resources :organizations do
    resources :members, only: [:index, :create, :destroy]
  end
  
  resources :posts do
    resources :comments, shallow: true
  end
  
  # Admin section
  namespace :admin do
    resources :users
    resources :settings, only: [:index, :update]
  end
end
