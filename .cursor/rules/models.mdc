# Rails Model Format

Models should be organized as follows:
- Constants first
- Associations second
- Validations third
- Scopes fourth
- Class methods fifth
- Instance methods sixth
- Private methods last.

Prefer simple validations and scopes over complex ones.

Keep models encapsulated. Use service objects for any complicated business logic.

Example:
```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  # Constants
  ROLES = %w[admin member guest].freeze
  
  # Associations
  belongs_to :organization
  has_many :posts
  
  # Validations
  validates :email, presence: true, uniqueness: true
  validates :name, presence: true
  
  # Scopes
  scope :active, -> { where(active: true) }
  
  # Class methods
  def self.find_by_email(email)
    find_by(email: email.downcase)
  end
  
  # Instance methods
  def full_name
    "#{first_name} #{last_name}"
  end
end
