# Rails Controller Format
# Rails Controller Format

Controllers should follow this format:
- Actions grouped by REST verb (GET, POST, etc.)
- Clear separation between actions with a newline
- Private methods at the bottom
- Strong params defined using a private method (using `params.expect` in Rails 8+).
- Each action should generally perform only one primary responsibility (e.g., fetching data, creating a resource, redirecting).
- Avoid complex business logic; delegate to service objects or models.
- Adhere to the Law of Demeter.

- **Authentication:**
  - Most controllers inherit from `ApplicationController`.
  - Authentication is typically handled automatically via the `before_action :require_authentication` defined in the `Authentication` concern ([app/controllers/concerns/authentication.rb](mdc:app/controllers/concerns/authentication.rb)), which is included in `ApplicationController`.
  - Unauthenticated access can be allowed using `allow_unauthenticated_access` where necessary.
  - Ensure controller tests simulate a logged-in user (e.g., by setting `Current.user`).

- **Authorization:**
  - Explicitly check authorization where necessary (e.g., ensuring `Current.user` owns the resource being modified or viewed in `show`, `edit`, `update`, `destroy` actions).

- **Strong Parameters (Rails 8+):**
  - Use `params.expect` for stricter validation of parameter structure.

  ```ruby
  # Example using params.expect
  private

  def assignment_params
    params.expect(
      assignment: [
        :title,
        :subject,
        # ... other permitted scalar attributes
        selected_documents: [[:id, :name, :url]] # Expects an array of hashes
      ]
    )
  end
  ```

Example Structure:
```ruby
class AssignmentsController < ApplicationController
  before_action :set_assignment, only: [:show, :destroy]

  # GET /assignments
  def index
    @assignments = Current.user.assignments.order(created_at: :desc)
  end

  # GET /assignments/:id
  def show
    # Authorization handled by set_assignment
  end

  # GET /assignments/new
  def new
    @assignment = Current.user.assignments.build
  end

  # POST /assignments
  def create
    # Use assignment_params with params.expect
    # Delegate creation logic to a service object ideally
    # ... handle success/failure ...
  end

  # DELETE /assignments/:id
  def destroy
    # Authorization handled by set_assignment
    @assignment.destroy
    redirect_to assignments_url, notice: "Assignment was successfully destroyed."
  end

  private

  def set_assignment
    @assignment = Current.user.assignments.find(params[:id])
  rescue ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound
    redirect_to assignments_url, alert: "Assignment not found."
  end

  # Define assignment_params using params.expect here
  # def assignment_params
  #   ...
  # end
end
