# Rails Controller Format

Controllers should follow this format:
- Actions grouped by REST verb (GET, POST, etc.)
- Clear separation between actions with a newline
- Private methods at the bottom
- Strong params defined using private method
- Use expect for strong params, not require
- Each action should do one thing well
- Do not put business logic in the controller - move it to service objects or models instead.
- Follow the law of delimiter
- Double check authorization and authentication

Example:
```ruby
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @users = User.all
  end

  def show
    @user = User.find(params[:id])
  end

  private

  def user_params
    params.require(:user).permit(:name, :email)
  end
end
