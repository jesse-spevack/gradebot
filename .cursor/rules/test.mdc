# Rails Test Format

Tests should follow this structure:
- Setup
- Exercise
- Verify
- Teardown (if needed)

Tests are to be used to drive development.

Tests should be considered documentation.

Use descriptive test names that explain the behavior being tested.
Favor simplicity over complexity in test cases.

Example:
```ruby
require 'test_helper'

class UserTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  test "should be valid with valid attributes" do
    # Setup
    user = User.new(name: "Test User", email: "test@example.com")
    
    # Exercise & Verify
    assert user.valid?
  end
  
  test "should not be valid without email" do
    # Setup
    user = User.new(name: "Test User")
    
    # Exercise & Verify
    assert_not user.valid?
    assert_includes user.errors[:email], "can't be blank"
  end
end
