# Tutorial: gradebot

GradeBot is an **AI-powered grading assistant** for teachers.
It helps grade student assignments written in *Google Docs* by integrating with Google Drive.
Teachers create assignments, select student work, and GradeBot uses **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to *automatically generate rubrics* (if needed) and provide *feedback* on the submitted documents.
It aims to save teachers time and provide consistent feedback.
