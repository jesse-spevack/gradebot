# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement LLM Processing Abstractions
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Build the ProcessingTask and ProcessingPipeline abstractions to handle the standardized workflow for LLM processing tasks.
# Details:
Create the ProcessingTask class to encapsulate LLM processing configuration and context. Implement ProcessingPipeline to orchestrate the processing flow. Build prompt builders for different task types (rubric generation, student feedback, assignment summary). Create response parsers for each task type to handle LLM responses. Implement storage services to save parsed results to the database. Create broadcaster services for real-time UI updates. Implement status management for tracking task progress. Add error handling, retries, and timeout mechanisms. Track processing time for performance metrics.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for ProcessingTask and ProcessingPipeline with mock LLM responses. Test prompt builders with various inputs to ensure correct prompt generation. Test response parsers with sample LLM responses. Test error handling with simulated failures. Measure processing time accuracy.
