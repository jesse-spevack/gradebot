# Task ID: 5
# Title: Create Criterion Model and Migration
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the Criterion model with attributes and associations.
# Details:
Create Criterion model with title (string), description (text), and position (integer). Add belongs_to :rubric association and has_many :levels association. Add validations for title presence. Create and run migration. Create fixture and model tests.

# Test Strategy:
Test validation for title presence. Test associations with rubric and levels. Test position attribute for proper ordering.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Generate Criterion model and migration file [in-progress]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the Criterion model file and generate the migration file with the required attributes
### Details:
1. Use Rails generator to create the Criterion model and migration:
   ```
   rails generate model Criterion title:string description:text position:integer rubric:references
   ```
2. This will create:
   - app/models/criterion.rb
   - db/migrate/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_create_criteria.rb
3. Verify the migration file includes the correct fields (title, description, position, and rubric reference)
4. Ensure the table name is 'criteria' (Rails should pluralize this correctly)
5. Test by inspecting the generated files to confirm they contain the expected fields

## 2. Update Criterion model with associations and validations [in-progress]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Add the required associations, validations, and any other model configurations
### Details:
1. Open app/models/criterion.rb
2. Add the belongs_to association:
   ```ruby
   belongs_to :rubric
   ```
3. Add the has_many association:
   ```ruby
   has_many :levels, dependent: :destroy
   ```
4. Add validation for title presence:
   ```ruby
   validates :title, presence: true
   ```
5. Ensure any other necessary model configurations are added
6. Update the Rubric model (if it exists) to include:
   ```ruby
   has_many :criteria, dependent: :destroy
   ```
7. Test by checking syntax and ensuring the model file contains all required elements

## 3. Run migration and create tests [in-progress]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2
### Description: Execute the migration and create fixture and model tests for the Criterion model
### Details:
1. Run the migration:
   ```
   rails db:migrate
   ```
2. Create fixture for Criterion in test/fixtures/criteria.yml:
   ```yaml
   criterion_one:
     title: First Criterion
     description: This is a test criterion
     position: 1
     rubric: one # assuming you have a rubric fixture

   criterion_two:
     title: Second Criterion
     description: Another test criterion
     position: 2
     rubric: one
   ```
3. Create model tests in test/models/criterion_test.rb:
   ```ruby
   require "test_helper"

   class CriterionTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
     test "should not save criterion without title" do
       criterion = Criterion.new(description: "Test", position: 1)
       assert_not criterion.save
     end

     test "should save valid criterion" do
       criterion = Criterion.new(title: "Test", description: "Test", position: 1, rubric: rubrics(:one))
       assert criterion.save
     end

     test "should have association with rubric" do
       criterion = criteria(:criterion_one)
       assert_not_nil criterion.rubric
     end
   end
   ```
4. Run the tests to verify:
   ```
   rails test test/models/criterion_test.rb
   ```
5. Verify the schema.rb file has been updated with the new table
