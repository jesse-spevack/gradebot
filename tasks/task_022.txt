# Task ID: 22
# Title: Review and Finalize Cost Tracking System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 20, 21
# Priority: medium
# Description: Double-check the existing cost tracking implementation for completeness and accuracy.
# Details:
Review existing CostTrackingSubscriber implementation. Verify token counting logic for all supported models. Check cost calculation formulas for accuracy. Test event handling for request_completed events. Verify fallback mechanism for direct cost tracking. Ensure proper data persistence for cost records. Update documentation for cost tracking system.

# Test Strategy:
Test cost calculation with sample responses from different models. Verify event handling with mock events. Test fallback mechanism by simulating event system failures. Validate data persistence and reporting functionality.
