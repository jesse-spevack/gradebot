# Task ID: 14
# Title: Create Assignment Form View
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13
# Priority: high
# Description: Build the form for creating new assignments.
# Details:
Create a form view at /assignments/new with fields for title (text input), subject (text input), grade level (select dropdown), and instructions (textarea). Add radio buttons for 'Generate rubric' or 'Paste rubric' options. Include a textarea for manual rubric input that appears conditionally when 'Paste rubric' is selected. Add a feedback tone dropdown with options: encouraging, neutral/objective, and critical. Use Stimulus for form interaction handling. Add a 'Submit for grading' button.

# Test Strategy:
Test form rendering with all required fields. Test conditional display of rubric textarea. Test form submission with both rubric options.
