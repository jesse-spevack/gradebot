# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Rails Project with Required Dependencies
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize a Rails 8+ project with Stimulus, Tailwind 4+, SQLite, and configure Solid gems (cache, queue, cable). Set up the deployment configuration with Kamal for GCP.
# Details:
Create a new Rails 8+ project with `rails new gradebot --database=sqlite3`. Install and configure Tailwind 4+ via the tailwindcss-rails gem. Add Stimulus for JavaScript interactions. Configure Solid gems (solid_cache, solid_queue, solid_cable) for background processing and real-time updates. Set up Kamal deployment configuration for Google Cloud Platform, including secrets management with the 1Password adapter. Configure minitest for testing with fixtures. Set up the Google API client with 'drive.file' scope for Google Docs integration.

# Test Strategy:
Create a basic test suite that verifies project initialization, confirms all dependencies are correctly installed, and validates the configuration of Solid gems. Test Google API connectivity with mock credentials.
