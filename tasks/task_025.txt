# Task ID: 25
# Title: Create ProcessingPipeline Abstraction
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 23, 24
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the ProcessingPipeline abstraction for orchestrating LLM workflows.
# Details:
Create ProcessingPipeline class to orchestrate LLM processing workflow. Implement methods for building prompts, making LLM requests, tracking processing time, parsing responses, storing results, managing status (including recording failures using ProcessingFailure model), and broadcasting updates. Add error handling, retry mechanisms, and timeout configuration.

# Test Strategy:
Test pipeline execution with mock ProcessingTask. Test each step of the workflow independently. Test error handling, failure recording, and retry mechanisms with simulated failures.
