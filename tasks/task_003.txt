# Title: Create Authentication System with Google OAuth
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement user authentication using Google OAuth to allow teachers to log in with their Google accounts and authorize access to Google Drive files.
# Details:
Integrate OmniAuth with Google OAuth2 provider. Configure the authentication flow to request 'drive.file' scope for Google Docs access. Create sessions controller to handle authentication callbacks. Implement user creation/lookup based on Google profile information. Add login/logout functionality with appropriate routes. Create middleware to ensure authenticated access to protected routes. Store Google OAuth tokens securely for API access. Implement token refresh mechanism for expired tokens.

# Test Strategy:
Create tests for authentication flow with mock OAuth responses. Test token storage and refresh mechanisms. Verify access restrictions on protected routes. Test user creation and lookup functionality with fixtures. Create integration tests for the complete login flow.
