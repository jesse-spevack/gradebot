# TODO

- [ ] Figure out how to track actual costs of requests 
  - We should store this in the DB so we can query costs by user, by grading task, by student submission, etc.
- [x] BUG: status bubbles on grading task are not updating without page refresh
- [ ] Styling of submission list and grade task need to be improved 
- [ ] Formatting of rubric and assignment prompt - consider trix for teachers and md for llm
- [ ] Formating of the feedback on the student submission page
- [ ] Show document name instead of document id 
- [ ] Add a summary of all student submissions to the grading task page
- [ ] Update the status timeline on the student submission page
